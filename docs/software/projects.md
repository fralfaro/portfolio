This repository serves as a hub for various Cheat Sheets related to 
the field of Data Science (with Python and R). What sets these Cheat Sheets apart is their 
multidimensional approach to enhancing the learning experience. 
Each Cheat Sheet is made available in three distinct formats: **PDF**, **Streamlit**, and **Google Colab**.

This threefold approach to guarantee that learners can interact with the content in 
a manner that aligns with their preferences and learning style.

[Vizzu](https://vizzuhq.com/) is a free and open-source animated data 
visualization library that utilizes a generic data visualization engine 
to generate various types of charts and seamlessly animate them.
